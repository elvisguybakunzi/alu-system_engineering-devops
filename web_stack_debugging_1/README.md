# Web Stack Debugging project #1

## Introduction

Welcome to the Web Stack Debugging project focusing on Nginx and Docker! This project aims to enhance your debugging skills by addressing issues within a web stack that involves the utilization of Nginx as a reverse proxy and Docker for containerization.

## Project Overview

In this scenario, we'll be working with a web stack that consists of the Nginx web server and Docker containers. Nginx serves as a reverse proxy, forwarding requests to appropriate Docker containers hosting various components of a web application. The objective is to identify and rectify any errors or misconfigurations that hinder the proper functioning of the web stack.

## Debugging Process

### Step 1: Review Nginx Configuration

Inspect the Nginx configuration files (`nginx.conf` and site-specific configuration files) to ensure that they are correctly set up. Look for any syntax errors or misconfigurations that might prevent Nginx from functioning as a reverse proxy.

### Step 2: Check Docker Containers

Examine the Docker containers that comprise your web application. Use the following commands to interact with Docker:

- `docker ps`: List running containers.
- `docker logs <container_id>`: View logs of a specific container.
- `docker exec -it <container_id> bash`: Access the shell of a container.

Ensure that each container is running as expected and that there are no error messages in the logs.

### Step 3: Troubleshoot Networking

Since Nginx is a reverse proxy, ensure that it is correctly configured to forward requests to the appropriate Docker containers. Check if the ports are correctly mapped and that there are no conflicts.

### Step 4: Debugging Tools

Utilize debugging tools such as `curl`, `telnet`, or browser developer tools to test the web application's response and identify any anomalies.

### Step 5: Error Messages

Pay attention to error messages. These can provide valuable insights into what might be causing the issues in the web stack.

### Step 6: Documentation and Online Resources

Refer to official documentation for Nginx, Docker, and any other components of your web stack. Online forums and communities can also be helpful for troubleshooting specific issues.
